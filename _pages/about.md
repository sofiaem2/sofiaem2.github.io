I am currently pursuing my Ph.D in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Computer Science and Education Department with Dr. H. Chad Lane as my advisor. My current 
reserach project aims to help students in non data science field learn the relevance of data science with the help of Large Language Models. My previous research projects
include work on STEM-C project and Eye-Tracking projects. The STEM-C project goal was to educate middle and high school students introductory computer science and data science skills in informal 
educaiton settings. Eye-Tracking project explored how programming experience affects code eye gaze patterns. For more details on the eye-tracking project please see publications.
